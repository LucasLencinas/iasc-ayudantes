## iasc-ayudantes - University Project
 > Small project for IASC lab classes
 
 This is a little app in NodeJs for putting on practice things like Promises, Sockets, http Servers, Asyncrounus Stuffs and NodeJs it self.
 Students ask questions to a list and the professors answer them. Pretty simple for now.
